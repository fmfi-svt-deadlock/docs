Welcome to Deadlock's documentation!
====================================

Project Deadlock is a system that controls access to a number of points of
access (e.g. doors, appliances) using RFID cards. Deadlock is designed for
security and reliability, assuming untrusted and unreliable network. Unlike existing commercial solutions, Deadlock is fully open-source and open-hardware, and designed  to be flexible, maintainable, scalable, and cost-effective. We provide tools and expose all interfaces and components, making Deadlock easy to integrate with existing systems and customize to the needs of the user.
