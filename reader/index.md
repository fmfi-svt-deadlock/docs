Reader
======

The Reader is the small box people touch with their cards. It provides simplistic visual and auditory interface (it blinks and beeps). It also reads the card and provides the controller with necessary information for deciding whether to open the door.

The Reader is connected to the Controller using a cable, utilizing a simple serial interface. It will also be developed in more models, Reader will only have the serial interface, Reader+ will also have USB capability, for use with other systems.
